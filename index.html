	<!--- Story Summary -->
		&ldquo;This website is a record of my journal, notebook, and photographs from my journey to the planet Safwania in 2009. My journal includes entries that I wrote during my free time while on the space mission. It includes details about my experiences in space, as well as details about remarkable objects that I saw. My notebook will include descriptions of the components from the system unit which I had to take apart while on the space mission, as it was malfunctioning. This mission was the first of its kind, and I was the first human being to set foot on a planet outside of our Solar System. Thus, I have decided to publish my record of the first TX-09 Space Shuttle mission, so that future generations can use this as a resource to find first-hand accounts of what happened.&rdquo;</p>
